This application in it's current state is a modest Spotify clone. A user logs in through spotify oauth and is redirected to my app where they have access to their actual spotify playlists. The user can create and unfollow playlists, edit playlist names, and add and remove tracks; any changes made from this app will affect that users actual spotify account in more or less real time.

In the future I will bring in user stats, song stats, etc. I would like to allow a user to generate playlists based on their favorite artists. I also plan to bring in another API that keeps track of when bands are coming to town and add in a feature that shows bands playing in the users town based on their favorite artists.

This is a MERN stack application, though currently the back end is functional not being used.
